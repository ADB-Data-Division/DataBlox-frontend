# Dataset constraints

We only commit datasets into the repository if and only if their data size is below 15MB. Otherwise, it should be added into the `.gitignore`.

# Dataset 0 and 1

Dear Mac and Darren:

Good day! Attached are the tourism counts at the district and province level.

Just wanted to add a small note about the computation: The counts reflect the number of trips that include the location of interest. For example, if the trip is X#A → X#B → X#C (where X is a province and A, B, and C are districts in X), then province X gets 1 count in the province-level tally. Districts A, B, and C each get 1 count in the district-level tally.

Let me know if we need to revise the computation or generate additional files :) 

Thank you, and happy weekend!

Very truly yours,
Mark Edward
